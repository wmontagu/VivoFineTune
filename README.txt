Welcome to your Discord Data Package!

Inside, you'll find a few JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files
of the data we use to provide Discord's service to you. We've chosen this format for ease of
processing. Furthermore, the files have been organized into logical groups to make them easy to
understand and work with (at least, we hope so)!

You should see the following folders in your data package (though some may be missing 
if you have no data of that type):

- Account: Contains your avatar and some additional account information
- Activity: Contains four folders (Analytics, Modeling, Reporting, Trust & Safety) with information 
about the actions you've taken on Discord (note: you will not have Analytics or Modeling folders 
in your data package if you've opted out of those activities)
- Activities: Contains folders with information about activities you have participated in 
on Discord, as well as any Activities-related user data and preferences
- Messages: Contains folders for each channel you've sent messages in, along with some information 
about those channels (note: manually-deleted messages are not stored in Discord and therefore won't 
be included in your Data package)
- Servers: Contains folders for each server you were a member of at the time of your data request.
- Programs: Contains any application information provided if you've previously applied to
the Partner Program, HypeSquad Program, or Verified Server Program
