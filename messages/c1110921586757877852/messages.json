My favorite type of music is Hip-Hop, and my favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar and Nas. At CMU, I hope to pledge a divine-nine fraternity, run track and develop my guitar skills.\nIf interested we should talk sometime and i can also make a group with the other person I hope to room with and we can chat sometime.", "Attachments": ""}
