The problem with jungling is I can notice everything, every callout or ping, support rotations from the enemy team,  no one listens. Every missed Yone R.  Every strategy the enemy clearly has developed more than us. I can see strengths as Hecarim and Orianna, but mostly weaknesses in our composition. They have Tristana Leona bottom, while we have Bard Jhin. I can see every death, every kill, every outplay, every misplay. And yet I am still lost. We are still lost. We did lose, many times, nearly every time. I hear every squeal of anger, every flaming shot popped. Every obscenity, things that everyone says while playing video games. Lab just could not compete. The level 3 Renekton roam top by Whitney Young. The cheater recall on the third wave in every lane, by Lane. The 0-20 game against Latin, where we tried to do a role swap, and failed miserably. Which reminds me of the forsaken plays we never talk about. Johnnyâ€™s Mundo gank and Seraphine positioning, Jamesâ€™ terrible teleports after the fight was over, Michaels refusal for rotations and dying by not listening, Brandon missing the 5th cannon minion in a row on a mage in mid lane. But I am not clean from fault. 50% of my ganks ended up with both of us dead. I couldnâ€™t decide on my pathing, red raptors group, or full clear, or five camps, or three.  I didnâ€™t prioritize the lane with our best player. I saw everything, but not my own mistakes. In a game like League of Legends, you want to blame one person, who solo lost the game, yet you canâ€™t. We lost, we all contributed to the loss, losing and losing my sanity, while screaming my head off with these teammates was the most fun I have ever had while playing this game.", "Attachments": ""},
