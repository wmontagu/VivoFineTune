I also hope to get more invested into the gym this summer and throughout my time at CMU. I like to play video games, mainly League of Legends, party/social games and roguelikes (Risk of Rain 2 & Gunfire Reborn). My favorite type of music is Hip-Hop, and my favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar and Nas. At CMU, I hope to pledge a divine-nine fraternity, run track and develop my guitar skills. I’m for the most part an early riser (6:45-8).\nI’m hoping to find a roommate interested in semi-suite doubles in Morewood Gardens or Mudge with me and two other people. Friend + dm me if interested.", "Attachments": ""}
