I received this because Jonathan Liu has been talking to this person and essentially referred him to me to look for club interest. I think this is more specific to our separate club demographic of people who want to play video games competitively. I also assume that the scope of the networking in different video games will be larger than the choices we have in the IHSEA. Of course, if we actually want to do something like this, we would have to talk to Mr. B first, and also contact the school board, although I personally know that the school is not very keen travelling because of COVID.", "Attachments": ""},
