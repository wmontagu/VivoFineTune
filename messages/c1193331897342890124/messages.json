Using existing, yet under-utilized technology, I propose a revolutionary approach to harness wind energy on a commercial scale, without those \"\"monstrously large and environmentally damaging windmills\"\". With my idea, we could start construction tomorrow and give our electrical grid the jolt it needs, creating a future where clean, quiet and efficient energy isn't a dream, but a reality we live in. This is not about every home being a power station, but about businesses driving a green revolution from the ground up!", "Attachments": ""},
